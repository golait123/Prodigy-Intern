# üîê Cybersecurity & Cryptography Tools ‚Äì Python Projects

A collection of beginner-friendly Python tools focused on cybersecurity, cryptography, and network analysis. These projects are intended for **educational and ethical use only**.

## üß∞ Tools Included

### 1. Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption
A classical encryption tool that allows users to:
- Input a message and shift value
- Encrypt or decrypt text using Caesar Cipher logic  
Great for understanding basic substitution ciphers.

### 2. Image Encryption via Pixel Manipulation
Encrypts and decrypts images using pixel-based operations:
- Swap pixel positions
- Apply simple mathematical transformations  
Introduces visual data obfuscation concepts.

### 3. Password Strength Checker
Evaluates the strength of a given password based on:
- Length
- Use of uppercase/lowercase letters
- Numbers and special characters  
Provides real-time feedback to improve security.

### 4. Basic Keylogger *(For Educational Use Only)*
Logs keyboard input and writes keystrokes to a file.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use only in controlled environments with proper permission. Intended solely for demonstrating how keyloggers work.

### 5. Packet Sniffer
Captures and analyzes network packets using libraries like `scapy`. Displays:
- Source and destination IPs
- Protocol types
- Payload content  
Useful for understanding packet structures and traffic flow.
